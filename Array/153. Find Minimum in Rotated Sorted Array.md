# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Description

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.



Example 1:<br>
> Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

Example 2:
> Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

Example 3:
> Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
> 
> Output: 11
> 
> Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.


Constraints:
> n == nums.length
> 
> 1 <= n <= 5000
> 
> -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
> 
> All the integers of nums are unique.
> 
> nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

## Solution

[二分查找：左右不对称，只比较mid和right的原因](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/solution/er-fen-cha-zhao-wei-shi-yao-zuo-you-bu-dui-cheng-z/)

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;                /* 左闭右闭区间，如果用右开区间则不方便判断右值 */ 
        while (left < right) {                      /* 循环不变式，如果left == right，则循环结束 */
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;    /* 地板除，mid更靠近left */
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {          /* 中值 > 右值，最小值在右半边，收缩左边界 */ 
                left = mid + 1;                     /* 因为中值 > 右值，中值肯定不是最小值，左边界可以跨过mid */ 
            } else if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) {   /* 明确中值 < 右值，最小值在左半边，收缩右边界 */ 
                right = mid;                        /* 因为中值 < 右值，中值也可能是最小值，右边界只能取到mid处 */ 
            }
        }
        return nums[left];    /* 循环结束，left == right，最小值输出nums[left]或nums[right]均可 */     
    }
